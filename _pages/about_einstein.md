My name is Minkyu Kweon (권민규), and I am currently a M.S. student with the [Human Computer Interaction Lab](http://hcil.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University, advised by [Prof.Jinwook Seo](http://hcil.snu.ac.kr/people/jinwook-seo).

I’m interested in **Natural Language Processing**, **Human-Computer Interaction**, and **Explainable AI**.

I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science Engineering from Seoul National University in 2024. I also worked as an intern developer in the Language AI Development Group at Samsung Electronics, where I developed an internal data cleaning tool for training language models.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want to discuss research collaboration.
